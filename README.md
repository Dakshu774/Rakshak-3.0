### Why I Built This

During late-night research and personal observations, I noticed a gap in how existing apps respond to emergencies. Rakshak started as a passion project â€” I wanted to build something that's actually useful in real-life risky situations. Everything in this app is designed to **act quickly and intelligently**, so help reaches you on time.
